## Code-to-Gist ü§ñ üõ†Ô∏è

This extension allows you to conveniently create and share GitHub Gists from your code files directly within the editor. Gists are a way to share snippets or larger portions of code with others, either as a public or secret gist, making it easy to collaborate or showcase your work.

### Features
- Create GitHub Gists: Create Gists by posting code files from your local VS Code environment to GitHub's Gist service.

- GitHub PAT: To authenticate with GitHub and create Gists, you'll need to provide a GitHub PAT (Personal Access Token), ensuring secure and authorized access, you can get that via your GitHub profile settings.

- File Selection: Choose specific code files to include in the Gist by selecting them through the file picker within the VS Code interface.

- Public or Private Gists: You can decide whether your Gist should be public or private, allowing you to control who can access and view your code snippets for safer collaboration.

### Troubleshooting
- **Error: "GitHub Personal Access Token is required"**: Ensure that you provide a valid GitHub Personal Access Token. Without it, the extension cannot authenticate and create Gists.
- **Error: "Please select a file"**: Make sure you select at least one code file to include in the Gist using the file picker modal.
- **Error: "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later."**: GitHub imposes rate limits on API requests. If you encounter this error, wait for some time before creating a new Gist.
